# Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks with Hyperparameter Tuning on Alphabets Data

## Overview
In this assignment, you will develop a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify data points from the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset into predefined categories of alphabets. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of ANNs and the significant role hyperparameter tuning plays in enhancing model performance.

## Dataset
**File**: `Alphabets_data.csv`

The dataset consists of labeled data suitable for a classification task aimed at identifying different alphabets. Preprocess the data to ensure optimal performance.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Load and explore the `Alphabets_data.csv` dataset.
- Summarize key features: number of samples, features, and classes.
- Execute necessary data preprocessing steps, including data normalization and managing missing values.

### 2. Model Implementation
- Construct a basic ANN model using a high-level neural network library (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).
- Ensure the model includes at least one hidden layer.
- Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
- Train the model on the training set and make predictions on the test set.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Modify various hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation functions, and learning rate.
- Observe the impact of these hyperparameters on model performance.
- Adopt a structured approach like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Document the methodology thoroughly.

### 4. Evaluation
- Employ suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- Discuss the performance differences between the model with default hyperparameters and the tuned model, emphasizing the effects of hyperparameter tuning.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy and completeness of the implementation.
- Proficiency in data preprocessing and model development.
- Systematic approach and thoroughness in hyperparameter tuning.
- Depth of evaluation and discussion.
- Overall quality of the report.
